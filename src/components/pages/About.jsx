      <p className="section-description">
        LuxeLoom was created for women who want dresses that feel as considered
        as couture, without the runway attitude. Every piece is cut in small
        batches with a focus on movement, drape, and longevity.

        We partner with family-owned mills across Italy and India to source
        silks, organza, and velvet that age beautifully. Our pattern makers
        refine each silhouette over multiple fittings so it works in real
        wardrobes—across cities, seasons, and occasions.
